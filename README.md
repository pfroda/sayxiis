### What is Sayxiis?

It is a app for who is tired for not be able to see anymore only photos on instagram or the photographers that you like. You can’t see any more their work because of the all random people with short videos came trying to seduce you. In this app you will be allowed only post photos, have a profile with your photos and the most fun part, it will have some kind of small competion like: “today only sky photos” and with tags and ranks (people will be able to vote in the photos) you can have fun doing it with others. Also I want at the end of the "day tag" (will reset at the midnight) the person with more votes get a "win sticker" that will show in their profile and everyone can compete to have a sticker and have fun posting a day tag photo.

### Creating User x

You need to have 1 user for the app run
(For now I don't have the implementation for the others users, if you put more than one user will break, yeah I need to make the getUserByID instead of getAllUsers)

Use postman to create one: POST: localhost:3001/users

```{
  "username": "User x",
  "email": "userx@email.com",
  "password": 123,
  "profilePicture": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544005313-94ddf0286df2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2188&q=80",
  "name": "User",
  "surname": "X",
  "intro": "User testing - Photos"
}
```

### Creating .env file

```{
DB_NAME=sayxdb - name of database Need be this one
DB_USER=postgres - Your username from Postgres
DB_PASSWORD=Yourpasswordhere -  Your password from postgress
DB_HOST=localhost  - Leave this likes this
DB_DIALECT=postgres  - Leave this likes this
DB_PORT=5432  - Leave this likes this
}
```

### Creating the tags:

You need create some tags on the DB for this app works
(in this ordem because I didn't make the random tags come from the DB 🤣🤣
I didn't have time!)

use postman with:

> POST: localhost:3001/tags

```
[
    {
        "name": "dog",
    },
    {
        "name": "cat",
    },
    {
        "name": "nature",
    },
    {
        "name": "holiday",
    },
    {
        "name": "food",
    },
    {
        "name": "building",
    },
    {
        "name": "plant",
    }
]
```
